# Remez Algorithm
Remez algorithm, also known as Exchange Algorithm, which solves the Minimax Approximation Problem. \
Run the 'main_Continuous_Minimax.m' and 'main_Discrete_Minimax.m' directly to obtain the results as displayed in experimental report.
# L2-Approximation Algorithm
Run the 'main_continuous_2norm.m' directly to obtain the results as displayed in experimental report.
